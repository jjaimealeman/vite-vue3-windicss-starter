I've been a big fan of TailwindCSS for over half a year. I recently read about the incredible work done by the Wonderful [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) team and especially the talented [Mr. Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/).

He is a Core team member of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](http://nuxtjs.org/) and [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/), and a valued Team member of [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/)

### Features [#](https://windicss.org/integrations/vite.html#features)

-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **It's FAST** - 20~100x times faster than Tailwind on Vite
-   üß© On-demand CSS utilities (Fully compatible with Tailwind CSS v2)
-   üì¶ On-demand native elements style resetting (preflight)
-   üî• Hot module replacement (HMR)
-   üçÉ Load configurations from `tailwind.config.js`
-   ü§ù Framework-agnostic - Vue, React, Svelte and vanilla!
-   üìÑ CSS `@apply` / `@screen` directives transforms (also works for Vue SFC's `<style>`)
-   üé≥ Support Variant Groups - e.g. `bg-gray-200 hover:(bg-gray-100 text-red-300)`
-   üòé ["Design in Devtools"](https://windicss.org/integrations/vite.html#design-in-devtools) - if you work this way in the traditional Tailwind, no reason we can't!
